# Copy Amazon Link bookmarklet

Get the short URL of the current product in Amazon

## Usage

1. Visit [lowply.github.io/copy-amazon-link](https://lowply.github.io/copy-amazon-link/)
1. Drag the link to your bookmark bar
1. Click bookmarklet on a page to get the link on your clipboard

## Developing locally

Requires Node.js to build the bookmarklet.

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory
1. Make changes to `copy-amazon-link.js`
1. Run `npm install && npm run compile`

## Development status

It works for me. It may not work in your browser of choice, and may break at any time if Amazon's markup changes.
